Cacao beans are roasted for a couple of hours until they develop a rich flavor. The outer shells are removed, and the interior nibs are ground to make a paste that can be mixed with cocoa butter to produce the desired percentage of chocolate.

Soy milk is widely available and is a great alternative to dairy milk in chocolate. It isn&rsquo;t as rich in fat as some vegan milks, but does have a neutral taste that makes it easy to combine with almost any other flavor.</p>\n<h2>Nut milks</h2>\n<p>Milks made from almonds and hazelnuts are easy to find on supermarket shelves, and are perfect for chocolate production. Like soy milk, they can be quite low in fat and therefore a little less creamy, but they have that nutty taste that goes so well with chocolate of all kinds.</p>\n<p>Many manufacturers will use a combination of the above milks to create the perfect consistency for their product.
