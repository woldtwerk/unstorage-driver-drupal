There are two common approaches to naming image styles: either based on the effects being applied (for example, <em>Square 85x85</em>), or based on where you plan to use it (for example, <em>Profile picture</em>).":"Cuando defina un estilo de imagen, tendrá que elegir un nombre que se muestre y un nombre de máquina. El nombre que se muestra aparece en las páginas administrativas, y el nombre de la máquina se utiliza para generar la URL con la que acceder a una imagen procesada en ese estilo. Hay dos enfoques comunes para nombrar estilos de imagen: ya sea a partir de los efectos que se aplican (por ejemplo, <em>Cuadro 85x85</em>), o en función de donde se va a utilizar (por ejemplo, <em>Foto de perfil</em>).","Configuring image fields":"Configurando campos de imagen","A few of the settings for image fields are defined once when you create the field and cannot be changed later; these include the choice of public or private file storage and the number of images that can be stored in the field. The rest of the settings can be edited later; these settings include the field label, help text, allowed file extensions, image resolution restrictions, and the subdirectory in the public or private file storage where the images will be stored. The editable settings can also have different values for different entity sub-types; for instance, if your image field is used on both Page and Article content types, you can store the files in a different subdirectory for the two content types.":"Algunas de las opciones para los campos de imagen son definidas una vez cuando se crea el campo y no pueden ser cambiadas más tarde; estos incluyen la elección de almacenaje publica o privada y el número de imágenes que pueden ser guardados en el campo. El resto de las opciones pueden ser editadas más tarde, esas opciones incluyen la etiqueta de campo, el texto de ayuda, las extensiones de archivo permitidas, las restricciones de resolución de imagen y el subdirectorio de almacenado público o privado de archivos. Las opciones editables pueden también tener diferentes valores para diferentes subtipo de entidad, por ejemplo: si su campo de imagen es usado en los tipos de contenido Página y Artículo, puede almacenar los archivos en un subdirectorio diferente para los dos tipos de contenido.","The maximum file size that can be uploaded is limited by PHP settings of the server, but you can restrict it further by configuring a <em>Maximum upload size</em> in the field settings (this setting can be changed later). The maximum file size, either from PHP server settings or field configuration, is automatically displayed to users in the help text of the image field.":"El tamaño máximo de archivo que se puede cargar está limitado por la configuración PHP del servidor, pero se puede restringir aún más ajustando un <em>tamaño máximo de carga<em> en los ajustes del campo (este ajuste se puede cambiar más adelante). El tamaño máximo de archivo, ya sea desde la configuración PHP del servidor o la configuración del campo, se muestra automáticamente a los usuarios en el texto de ayuda del campo de imagen.","You can also configure a default image that will be used if no image is uploaded in an image field. This default can be defined for all instances of the field in the field storage settings when you create a field, and the setting can be overridden for each entity sub-type that uses the field.":"También puede configurar una imagen predeterminada que se utilizará si no hay imagen se carga en un campo de imagen.

You can filter a view to a fixed language choice, such as English or Spanish, or to the language selected by the page the view is displayed on (the language that is selected for the page by the language detection settings either for Content or User interface).":"Si su sitio tiene múltiples idiomas y entidades traducidas, cada fila resultado en una vista contendrá una traducción para cada entidad involucrada (una vista puede incluir múltiples entidades si usa relaciones). Puede usar un filtro para restringuir la vista a un idioma: sin filtro, si una entidad tiene tres traducciones, eso añadirá tres filas a los resultados; si filtra por idioma, a lo sumo un resultado se desplegará (puede ser cero si esa entidad en particular no tiene una traducción que coincida con la selección de su filtro de idioma). Si una vista usa relaciones, cada entidad en la relación necesita ser filtrada por separado. Puede filtrar una vista a un idioma definido, como Inglés o Español, o a un idioma seleccionado por la página en la que la vista se está desplegando (el idioma que es seleccionado para la página por las configuraciones de detección de idioma ya sea por la interfaz de Contenido o de Usuario).",'Because each result row contains a specific translation of each entity, field-level filters are also relative to these entity translations. For example, if your view has a filter that specifies that the entity title should contain a particular English word, you will presumably filter out all rows containing Chinese translations, since they will not contain the English word. If your view also has a second filter specifying that the title should contain a particular Chinese word, and if you are using "And" logic for filtering, you will presumably end up with no results in the view, because there are probably not any entity translations containing both the English and Chinese words in the title.':'Debido a que cada fila de resultados contiene una traducción específica de cada entidad, los filtros de nivel de campo también están relacionados con estas traducciones de la entidad. Por ejemplo, si su vista tiene un filtro que especifica que el título de la entidad debe contener una palabra en particular en inglés, podrá supuestamente filtrar todas las filas que contienen traducciones al chino, ya que no contienen la palabra en inglés. Si su vista también tiene un segundo filtro que se especifica que el título debe contener una palabra china en particular, y si está utilizando lógica "And" para el filtrado, probablemente terminará sin resultados en la vista, ya que probablemente no hay ninguna traducción de entidad que contenga tanto las palabras chinas y en inglés en el título.','Independent of filtering, you can choose the display language (the language used to display the entities and their fields) via a setting on the display. Your language choices are the same as the filter language choices, with an additional choice of "Content language of view row" and "Original language of content in view row", which means to display each entity in the result row using the language that entity has or in which it was originally created. In theory, this would give you the flexibility to filter to French translations, for instance, and then display the results in Spanish. The more usual choices would be to use the same language choices for the display language and each entity filter in the view, or to use the Row language setting for the display.':'Independientemente del filtrado, puede elegir el idioma visualizado (el idioma utilizado para mostrar las entidades y sus campos) a través de una opción en la visualización. Su elección de idioma son los mismos que las elecciones del filtro de idioma con un opción adicional de "Idioma de contenido de la vista de fila" e "Idioma original del contenido de la vista de fila", lo que significa que mostrará cada entidad la fila resultante usando el idioma que tenga la entidad o en el cual fue originalmente creado. En teoría, esto le daría la flexibilidad de filtrar traducciones en francés y después mostrar los resultados en español. La elección más usual sería usar el mismo idioma para el idioma de visualización y cada filtro de entidad en la vista o usar la opción de idioma de fila para la visualización.',"Entity link":"Enlace de entidad","Entity delete link":"Enlace de eliminación de entidad","Entity edit link":"Enlace de edición de entidad","Link to @entity_type_label":"Enlace a @entity_type_label","Provide a view link to the @entity_type_label.":"Proporciona un enlace de visualización a @entity_type_label.","Link to edit @entity_type_label":"Enlace para editar @entity_type_label","Provide an edit link to the @entity_type_label.":"Proporciona un enlace de edición a @entity_type_label.","Link to delete @entity_type_label":"Enlace para eliminar @entity_type_label","Provide a delete link to the @entity_type_label.":"Proporciona un enlace de eleminación a @entity_type_label.","Options such as paging, table sorting, and exposed filters will not initiate a page refresh.":"Opciones tales como paginado, ordenamiento de tablas, y filtros expuestos no refrescarán la página.","Select pager":"Seleccionar el paginador",'This can be an internal Drupal path such as node/add or an external URL such as "https://www.drupal.org".

The <em>public</em> file directory, which is configured in your settings.php file, is the default place for storing uploaded files. Links to files in this directory contain the direct file URL, so when the files are requested, the web server will send them directly without invoking your site code. This means that the files can be downloaded by anyone with the file URL, so requests are not access-controlled but they are efficient. The <em>private</em> file directory, also configured in your settings.php file and ideally located outside the site web root, is access controlled. Links to files in this directory are not direct, so requests to these files are mediated by your site code. This means that your site can check file access permission for each file before deciding to fulfill the request, so the requests are more secure, but less efficient. You should only use the private storage for files that need access control, not for files like your site logo and background images used on every page.

Esto significa que los archivos pueden ser descargados por cualquiera con la URL del archivo, por lo que las solicitudes de acceso no son controlados pero son eficientes. El directorio de archivo <em>private</em>, también configurados en su archivo settings.php e idealmente localizado fuera de la raíz del sitio web, su acceso sí es controlado. Los enlaces a los archivos en este directorio no son directos, por lo que las solicitudes de acceso a esos archivos son mediados por el código de su sitio.

One common example of taxonomy is the tags used to classify or categorize posts in a blog website; a cooking website could use an ingredients taxonomy to classify recipes. Individual taxonomy items are known as <em>terms</em> (the blog tags or recipe ingredients in these examples); and a set of terms is known as a <em>vocabulary</em> (the set of all blog post tags, or the set of all recipe ingredients in these examples). Technically, taxonomy terms are an entity type and the entity subtypes are the vocabularies; see @content_structure_topic for more on content entities. Like other entities, taxonomy terms can have fields attached; for instance, you could set up an image field to contain an icon for each term.":"La <em>taxonomía</em> se utiliza para clasificar el contenido del sitio web. Un ejemplo común de taxonomía son las etiquetas utilizadas para clasificar o categorizar publicaciones en un sitio web de blog; un sitio web de cocina podría usar una taxonomía de ingredientes para clasificar recetas. Los elementos de taxonomía individuales se conocen como <em>términos</em> (las etiquetas de blog o los ingredientes de recetas en estos ejemplos); y un conjunto de términos se conoce como <em>vocabulario</em> (el conjunto de todas las etiquetas de publicaciones de blog o el conjunto de todos los ingredientes de recetas en estos ejemplos). Técnicamente, los términos de taxonomía son un tipo de entidad y los subtipos de entidad son los vocabularios; consulte @content_structure_topic para obtener más información sobre las entidades de contenido. Al igual que otras entidades, los términos de la taxonomía pueden tener campos adjuntos; por ejemplo, puede configurar un campo de imagen para que contenga un icono para cada término.","An individual vocabulary can organize its terms in a hierarchy, or it could be flat. For example, blog tags normally have a flat structure, while a recipe ingredients vocabulary could be hierarchical (for example, tomatoes could be a sub-term of vegetables, and under tomatoes, you could have green and red tomatoes).":"Un vocabulario individual puede organizar sus términos en una jerarquía, o puede ser plano. Por ejemplo, las etiquetas de un blog suelen tener una estructura plana, mientras que el vocabulario de ingredientes de una receta puede ser jerárquico (por ejemplo, los tomates pueden ser un subtérmino de las verduras, y dentro de los tomates, puede haber tomates verdes y rojos).","Taxonomy terms are normally attached as reference fields to other content entities, which is how you can use them to classify content. When you set up a taxonomy reference field, you can let users enter terms in two ways:":"Los términos de la taxonomía se adjuntan normalmente como campos de referencia a otras entidades de contenido, que es como se pueden utilizar para clasificar el contenido. Cuando se configura un campo de referencia de taxonomía, se puede permitir a los usuarios introducir términos de dos maneras:","New terms can be created right on the content editing form.":"Se pueden crear nuevos términos directamente en el formulario de edición de contenidos.","Fixed list of terms":"Lista fija de términos","The list of terms is curated and managed outside the content editing form, and users can only select from the existing list when editing content.":"La lista de términos se elabora y gestiona fuera del formulario de edición de contenidos, y los usuarios sólo pueden seleccionarlos de la lista existente al editar los contenidos.","User guide on Taxonomy":"Guía del usuario sobre Taxonomía","<em>Page settings</em>, <em>Block settings</em>, etc.: settings specific to the display type, such as the URL for a page display.
